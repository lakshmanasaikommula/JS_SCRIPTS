// JS OPERATORS 

/*JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement 

JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	Example	Same As
=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y
/=	x /= y	x = x / y
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
**=	x **= y	x = x ** y  

JavaScript Comparison Operators
Operator	Description
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator

JavaScript Logical Operators
Operator	Description
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not


JavaScript Type Operators
Operator	Description
typeof	Returns the type of a variable
instanceof	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
Type operators are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter.

JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.

Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
Operator	Description	Example	Same as	Result	Decimal
&	AND	5 & 1	0101 & 0001	0001	 1
|	OR	5 | 1	0101 | 0001	0101	 5
~	NOT	~ 5	 ~0101	1010	 10
^	XOR	5 ^ 1	0101 ^ 0001	0100	 4
<<	left shift	5 << 1	0101 << 1	1010	 10
>>	right shift	5 >> 1	0101 >> 1	0010	  2
>>>	unsigned right shift	5 >>> 1	0101 >>> 1	0010	  2
The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned examples. But JavaScript uses 32-bit signed numbers.
Because of this, in JavaScript, ~ 5 will not return 10. It will return -6.
~00000000000000000000000000000101 will return 11111111111111111111111111111010

Bitwise operators are fully described in the JS Bitwise chapter.
