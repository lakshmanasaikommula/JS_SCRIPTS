/* JS variabls
4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing */ 

/* JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
Note
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. */ 

//example 

let name = 'sai'
let Name = 'hi' //both are not same 

console.log(name)
console.log(Name)

//a=1
//console.log(a)

//let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
//a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
//b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
//c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c

a =5; b = 6; c = a+b; console.log(c)

//When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
